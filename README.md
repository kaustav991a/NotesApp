# Expense Tracker Application

## Overview

This is a personal expense tracker application built using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. It allows users to easily track their income and expenses, view their balance, and analyze their spending habits.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using Firebase Auth.
* **Add Expenses/Income:** Simple forms to record new transactions with details like name, type (income/expense), amount, date, and optional invoice upload.
* **View Transactions:** Display a history of all transactions, sorted by date.
* **Home Dashboard:** Provides an overview of the total balance, income, and expenses.
* **Transaction Details:** A dedicated page to view the complete information for a specific transaction.
* **Edit Transactions:** Allows users to modify existing transaction details.
* **Statistics/Analytics:** (Potentially) Visualizations or summaries of spending patterns.
* **Notification System:** (In progress) Alerts for low balance and potentially other reminders.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React
    * React Router DOM (for navigation)
    * Framer Motion (for animations)
    * Sass (for styling)
    * Font Awesome and Material Design Icons
* **Backend:**
    * Firebase
        * Firebase Authentication
        * Firebase Firestore (for database)
        * Firebase Cloud Functions (for backend logic and notifications)
        * Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push notifications)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd your-frontend-directory (e.g., src or root if your package.json is there)
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Enable Authentication (Email/Password).
    * Create a Firestore database.
    * Enable Cloud Messaging and get your Web VAPID key (Project settings > Cloud Messaging > Web Push certificates).
    * Get your Firebase project configuration object from the Firebase console (Project settings > General > Your apps > Web).

4.  **Configure Firebase in your React app:**
    * Create a `firebase.js` file (if you haven't already) in your frontend directory.
    * Replace the placeholder values in the `firebaseConfig` object with your Firebase project credentials.
    * Make sure to include your VAPID key when initializing Firebase Messaging.

    ```javascript
    // src/firebase.js
    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
    import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
    import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
    import { getMessaging } from 'firebase/messaging';

    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
    };

    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    export const auth = getAuth(app);
    export const db = getFirestore(app);
    export const messaging = getMessaging(app); // Initialize messaging
    ```

5.  **Set up Cloud Functions (optional, if you have backend logic):**
    * Make sure you have the Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`).
    * Log in to Firebase (`firebase login`).
    * Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal.
    * Initialize Firebase Functions if you haven't already (`firebase init functions`). Choose JavaScript as the language.
    * Install any necessary dependencies for your Cloud Functions in the `functions` directory (`cd functions && npm install`).
    * Deploy your Cloud Functions (`firebase deploy --only functions`).

6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cd your-frontend-directory
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
